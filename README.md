    letter = f"""Hi {crush_name},

I hope this letter doesnâ€™t catch you by surprise, but Iâ€™ve been meaning to write this for quite some time. 
There are things I want to tell you that I canâ€™t always express in casual conversations, 
so I thought maybe writing them down would be the best way.

Since the day I met you, youâ€™ve made such a big difference in my life without even trying. 
You have this way of making everything around you feel lighter and happier. Whether itâ€™s your smile, 
the way you talk, or simply your presence, I always find myself looking forward to seeing you. 
Even the smallest momentsâ€”like a quick conversation or a simple jokeâ€”stay with me far longer than you probably realize.

Little by little, I noticed myself caring more about you,
 thinking of you when something reminds me of your laugh, 
 or when I hear a song that makes me smile the way you do. 
 I realized itâ€™s more than just admiration or friendshipâ€”itâ€™s something deeper.
   I like you, not just for how amazing you are on the outside, but for the kind,
     genuine, and thoughtful person Iâ€™ve come to know.

Iâ€™ll be honest, it took me some courage to say this because I didnâ€™t want to risk our friendship or make things awkward.
 But I believe that being honest about my feelings is something you deserve.
   Youâ€™re truly special to me, and I want you to know how much you mean in my life.

I donâ€™t expect you to feel the same way right away, 
and I donâ€™t want to pressure you into an answer.
 I just wanted you to know whatâ€™s been in my heart. No matter what happens,
 Iâ€™ll always be grateful for the happiness you bring me and for the chance to know someone as wonderful as you.

With all sincerity,
Kier
